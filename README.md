# GitHub Actions Runner

This image is an extension of [myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner] that:

- Supports scaling via [docker-compose up --scale SERVICE=NUM] or the [compose file v2 scale] option.

## Usage

Here is an example compose file with scaling:

```yaml
services:
  worker:
    image: runner
    restart: always
    environment:
      RUNNER_WORKDIR: /tmp/_work
      RUNNER_GROUP: default
      RUNNER_SCOPE: 'org'
      ACCESS_TOKEN: ghp_...
      ORG_NAME: OCTOPUS
      CONFIGURED_ACTIONS_RUNNER_FILES_DIR: /tmp/_work/_actions
      LABELS: ubuntu-latest
    security_opt:
      # needed on SELinux systems to allow docker container to manage other docker containers
      - label:disable
    volumes:
      - '/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock'
      - '/tmp/_work:/tmp/_work'
      - '/tmp/_work/_actions:/tmp/_work/_actions'
      # note: a quirk of docker-in-docker is that this path
      # needs to be the same path on host and inside the container,
      # docker management cmdÂ´s run outside of docker but expect the paths from within
```
